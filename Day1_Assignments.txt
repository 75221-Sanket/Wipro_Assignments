Algorithm

1. Declare the variable called Shape and the shape from user

2. Check if shape is Rectangle

Declare length and width and get the value from the user declare Area and store the area of the rectangle.

Print Area

3. Check if shape is "Square"

Declare variable called Side and get it from the user Declare variablle called Area and stored the area of the square print Area

4. Check if shape is "Circle" Declare variable called radius and get value from user Declare variablle called Area and stored the area of the Circle print Area


Pseudocode

1.start

2. Declare string shape; 

3. if shape == "Rectangle"

   Declare int length, Width;
   Declare int Area length Width

   Print Area

4. if shape == "Square" Declare int Side
 
    Declare int Area Side*Side

   Print Area

5.if shape "Circle"

   Declare int radius

   print radius

3)
Algorithm


1.Declare variables Mark1, Mark2, Mark3, Mark4, Mark5 and the values of earch marks

2.Declare Average to store the average of 5 marks.

3.Add all the marks and divide it by 5 to get the average

4 . if average is 65 to 75 print good 5.or average is 45 to 65 print pass

5 or average is below 45 print fail



Pseudocode

sum = 0

1) FOR i = 1 TO 5 DO
    PRINT "Enter mark", i, ": "
    INPUT mark
    sum = sum + mark
END FOR

2) average = sum / 5


3) ELSE IF average >= 60 AND average < 75 THEN
    PRINT "Good"
4) ELSE IF average >= 45 AND average < 60 THEN
    PRINT "Pass"
5) ELSE
    PRINT "Fail"
6) END IF
